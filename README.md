# Drupal Console global extend 

This is still a WIP approach to extend DrupalConsole commands globally.

Instructions to extend Drupal Console libraries within a drupal site may vary.

## Installing
```
cd ~/.console/
composer create-project \
jmolivas/drupal-console-global-extend:dev-master extends \
--no-dev \
--keep-vcs \
--no-interaction
```
